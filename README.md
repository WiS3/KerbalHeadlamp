Add EVA Kerbal Headlamps like in KSP1.

You can toggle them using the **Vessel Action** icon aswell the **Lights** ActionGroup (default is **U** Key).

You can also change the color of the light by expanding the advanced controls in the *Parts Manager*.

Known issues: 
- If there are multiple Kerbals on EVA the light setting is shared for all of them.
